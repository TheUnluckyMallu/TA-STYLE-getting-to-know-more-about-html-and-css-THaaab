        <img src="" alt="A guy staring to pits of darkness" width="300px" height="300px">
        <p> This page was established after the author lost his dream/achivment on what he wanted to become, after he forced to resign from  an unhealthywork enviornament on Dec 2019. Since then he was told to stayin his father's office. Every time he carved a new path, shared among the family, he was asked the same question "Are you sure you can do this, if yes, go for it, but don't think about getting support if you fail."  by his father with an unintrested emotion. And his reply is a sillence, with his faceshowing lack of self-confidence.
